Basics of the Swift features and OOP.

It's a rep where I'm studying Swift. The most of the lessons are from the book "Vyachslav Usov. Basics of application development for iOS" and web-site swiftme.ru. As the Swift is OOP language there are a lot of OOP basic concepts. 

Purposes of this rep:
  1. Practice in Git commands and Git Hub
  2. Show other people, what I've studied
